<h1>Scrabble Solver</h1>

<p>This scrabble solver is cool for two reasons
1. it comes up with all the possible word combinations, given a set of letters
2. it matches the possible word combinations against a pattern.</p>

<h2>Pattern</h2>

<p>b+ =&gt; word that starts with a b
+b =&gt; word that ends with a b
t_p =&gt; word that starts with a T and ends with a B (tip, top, tap)
t+p+ =&gt; word that starts with a T has some string of letters, then a P, then another string of letters (Technophobe, Technophile)</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>there are always next steps, but I think there are two immediate problems
1. ability to find words with multiple constraints
2. optimizations, it sucks to run the program and have to wait 500ms. </p>
