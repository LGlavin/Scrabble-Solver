<h1>Scrabble Solver</h1>

<p>This scrabble solver is cool for two reasons
1. it comes up with all the possible word combinations, given a set of letters
2. it matches the possible word combinations against a pattern.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>ruby scrabble_solver.rb bttale
=&gt; bat, tab, battle, table</p>

<p>ruby scrabble_solver.rb bttale b+
=&gt; bat, battle</p>

<h2>Pattern</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>b+ =&gt; word that starts with a b</p></li>
<li><p>+b =&gt; word that ends with a b</p></li>
<li><p>t_p =&gt; word that starts with a T and ends with a B (tip, top, tap)</p></li>
<li><p>t+p+ =&gt; word that starts with a T has some string of letters, then a P, then another string of letters (Technophobe, Technophile)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>there are always next steps, but I think there are two immediate problems</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ability to find words with multiple constraints</p></li>
<li><p>the program takes about half a second to run (500ms). This is too slow in practice. </p></li>
</ol>
